# Advent of Code 2023
I'm using Python this year because I don't have the time to use something else :(

## Usage
Use the `aoc.py` script to run solutions like so:

```console
❯ ./aoc.py 1
```

## Testing
I use pytest for validating that my solution matches the expected output from the sample data in each problem. To run a test:

```console
❯ pytest solutions/test_day1.py
```
